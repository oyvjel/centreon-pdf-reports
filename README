Reports:
========
Host availablility.
-------------------
Specify at least one "Linked HostGroups" to activate. 
Availability report for each host in hostgroup including a summary will be generated.  A summary for each day in the time perioad will be appended.

Service group
-------------
Specify at least one "Linked ServiceGroups" to activate.
Each service ( host_id, service_id) in the service groups will be included in availability report. 
Note that host services in service groups are specified by directly linking services defined on hosts to servicegroup or by linking services defined on hostgroups.
In the last case report for each member host in hostgroup is generated for the specified service.

Note that a host can not be a member of multiple hostgroups with the same service-name linked. This imposes som problems in decopeling host selection from service specification. The next  (new) report tries to solve this.

Services on hosts i hostgroup
-----------------------------
Hosts are specified by "Linked HostGroups". Service statisticts, like in the service hostgroup report, for all services matching a category on each host is generated.
The report is activated by specifying a category index. Specify 0 to select all sercvices on hosts and blank to disable report.
